Automated characer sheet for Pathfinder written in Python. 

Goals are to include auto-filling of fields (skills, attributes, and combat 
stats), quick and easy access to spell lists, and class-based skill generation.

Despite the name, is not focusing on Dungeons&Dragons character generation, but 
rather solely on Pathfinder.
